# Reading list

!!! Note
   [How to read academic papers](https://medium.com/ai-saturdays/how-to-read-academic-papers-without-freaking-out-3f7ef43a070f)

Particularly for systems security papers: 
    (1) Read Abstract -> Introduction -> Conclusion
    (2) Find and read a motivation (representative) example or case studies. They include a complete (and often realistic) story and how the proposed idea solves the problem with newly proposed methods.
