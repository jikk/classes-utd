## Course Description

CS 6332 is a graduate-level, research-oriented, systems, and software, security
class. The course mainly focus on security issues on system and software
programs. Therefore the course will cover

* The basics concepts regarding the system and program,
* Attacker tactics and techniques to take over software systems,
* Countering security measures to monitor, analyze, and mitigate variety sets of security security issues.

### Learning expectations

Through this course, students will learn

* Basics of computer system and software systems with special stress on
  initialization and its subsequent program executions.
  
* Students will learn the variety of attacker tactics and techniques evolve over
  time to exploit security holes along with counterpart defense mechanisms.

* Different reverse engineering techniques to monitor, analyze, and mitigate
  (both benign and malicious) program activities which would include secure system design
  principles; dynamic and static analysis approaches for different program
  representation -- source code, binary, compiler IR, and byte-codes; VMM
  (hypervisor) techniques to instrument runtime process.
