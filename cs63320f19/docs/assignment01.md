# Assignment 0x01

## Assignment set-up

### GDB Plug-in

In this document, I will use [PEDA](http://ropshell.com/peda/) GDB Plugin, to illustrate assignment details.

    # install PEDA
    $ git clone https://github.com/longld/peda.git ~/peda
    $ echo "source ~/peda/peda.py" >> ~/.gdbinit

You can also try to use more updated GDB plug-ins such as [gef](https://github.com/hugsy/gef), [pwndbg](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg).

### Disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)

In this assignment (part2 and part3), you can need to disable ASLR. Use one of the following commands.

    echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

or 

    sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0

or 

    setarch `uname -m` -R /bin/bash

To open a new *bash* shell for you with ASLR disabled.

## Part 1 (4pt): Control flow hijacking

### Preparation ###

Download *crackme0x00* from http://cs6332.syssec.org/crackmes/crackme0x00

### Description ###

In this assignment, we are going to hijack the control flow of *crackme0x00* binary
by overwriting the instruction pointer. As a first step, let's make it print
out "Password OK :)" without providing correct answer to your question.

```
$ objdump -d crackme0x00
...
    8048469:       e8 e2 fe ff ff          call   8048350 <strcmp@plt>
    804846e:       85 c0                   test   %eax,%eax
    8048470:       74 0e                   je     8048480 <main+0x6c>
    8048472:       c7 04 24 96 85 04 08    movl   $0x8048596,(%esp)
    8048479:       e8 c2 fe ff ff          call   8048340 <printf@plt>
    804847e:       eb 0c                   jmp    804848c <main+0x78>
 -> 8048480:       c7 04 24 a9 85 04 08    movl   $0x80485a9,(%esp)
    8048487:       e8 b4 fe ff ff          call   8048340 <printf@plt>
    804848c:       b8 00 00 00 00          mov    $0x0,%eax
    8048491:       c9                      leave
    8048492:       c3                      ret
```

main function will return to `0x08048480` such that it prints out "Password OK :)". Which characters in input should be changed to 0x08048480? Let me remind you that x86 is a little-endian machine.

What happens if you provide a long string? Like below.

    $ echo AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA | ./crackme0x00
    CS6332 Crackme Level 0x00
    Password: Invalid Password!
    Segmentation fault

There are a few ways to check the status of the last segmentation
fault:

1. checking logging messages

        $ dmesg | tail -1
        [237413.117757] crackme0x00[353]: segfault at 41414141 ip 0000000041414141 sp 00000000ff92aef0
        error 14 in libc-2.24.so[f7578000+1b3000]

2. running gdb

        $ echo AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA > input
        $ gdb ./crackme0x00
        > run <input
        Starting program: ./crackme0x00 <input
        CS6332 Crackme Level 0x00
        Password: Invalid Password!

        Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
        0x41414141 in ?? ()

### Control EIP ###

Let's figure out which input tainted the instruction pointer.

    $ echo AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHHIIIIJJJJ > input
    $ dmesg | tail -1
    [238584.915883] crackme0x00[1095]: segfault at 48484848 ip 0000000048484848 sp 00000000ffc32f80
    error 14 in libc-2.24.s

What's the current instruction pointer? You might need this help:

    $ man ascii

You can also figure out the exact shape of the stack frame by looking at
the instructions as well.

    $ objdump -d crackme0x00
    ...
    8048414:       55                      push   %ebp
    8048415:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
    8048417:       83 ec 28                sub    $0x28,%esp
    ...
    8048448:       8d 45 e8                lea    -0x18(%ebp),%eax
    804844b:       89 44 24 04             mov    %eax,0x4(%esp)
    804844f:       c7 04 24 8c 85 04 08    movl   $0x804858c,(%esp)
    8048456:       e8 d5 fe ff ff          call   8048330 <scanf@plt>
    ...

### Output to submit

Save your attack payload to `input1`. The expected running example would be like the following.

    $ cat input1 | ./crackme0x00
    CS6332 Crackme Level 00
    Password: Invalid Password!
    Password OK :)
    Segmentation fault


## Part 2 (8 point): Return-to-libc

### Preparation

For this part, we will use *crackme0x00* binary again. Download *crackme0x00* from http://cs6332.syssec.org/crackmes/crackme0x00 and check its binary to ensure stack section (*GNU_STACK*) is in `RW` permission which mean you can overwrite a stack, but cannot run any code from there.

```
$ readelf -W -l ./crackme0x00|grep STACK
  GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000 RW  0x4
```

### Description

From this part of the assignment, you can still hijack the control by overwriting the return address, but you donâ€™t know where to transfer the control, to run the desired command (say */bin/sh*). In this part of the assignment, we want to use *system()* function provided by Glibc library. For its usage, please check out `man -s 3 system`.

Please write an input that would overwrite the address of *system()* to return address of main() and transfer the control aa *main()* function returns. Don't forget to find a way to pass a string of command that you want to run (*/bin/sh*) as the first function argument to *system()* function. You can provide it from your stack or you can simply search for the string from Glibc.

#### *system()* function example

The above snippet would give you a command prompt.

```bash
$ cat << EOF > /tmp/system.c
#include <stdlib.h>
// system.c
int main() {
    system("/bin/sh");
}
EOF

$ gcc /tmp/system.c
$ ./a.out
$ whoami
kjee
```

### Getting addresses of necessary ingredients.

* GDB (Peda) will the address of *system()* at runtime. 

```
$ gdb  crackme0x00
gdb-peda$ b main
gdb-peda$ run
...

gdb-peda$ print system
$1 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0xf7e26d10 <system>
```

`0xf7e26d10` is address that you want to return to run the function.

### Output to submit

Save your attack payload to `input2`. The expected running example would be like the following. You will pretend *env -i*, so as for the stack layout to be more deterministic.

    $ cat input2 | env -i ./crackme0x00
    CS6332 Crackme Level 00
    Password: Invalid Password!
    $ whoami
    kjee

## Part 3 (8 piont): Jump Shellcode

### Prepration

Download *crackme0x00-nonx* from http://cs6332.syssec.org/crackmes/crackme0x00-nonx and check its binary to ensure stack section (*GNU_STACK*) is in `RWE` permission which mean you can write and run a shellcode snippet from stack.

```
$ readelf -W -l ./crackme0x00-nonx|grep STACK
  GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000 RWE 0x10
```

### Description

From this assignment, PEDA will generate a shellcode. You will craft an input to overwrite the stack with shellcode and transfer control the beginning of shellcode as *main()* function returns. You can google for *execve() shellcode x86* that would eventually run */bin/sh* command for you.

Check shellcode length, and make sure shellcode should fit in to stack.

Let's see we have enough space in stack.

```
$ objdump -j .text -d crackme0x00-nonx
...
5bc:	83 ec 20             	sub    $0x30,%esp
...
```

Create an input that would run *shellcode* and subsequently give */bin/sh* prompt. Please note that different lengths of environment variables + arguments can also vary the resulting stack address widely from computer to computer. A way to mitigate this issue is doing a NOP slide (see https://old.liveoverflow.com/binary_hacking/protostar/stack5.html).

### Output to submit

Save your attack payload to `input2`. The expected running example would be like the following. You will pretend *env -i*, so as for stack layout to be more deterministic.

    $ cat input3 | env -i ./crackme0x00-nonx
    CS6332 Crackme Level 00
    Password: Invalid Password!
    $ whoami
    kjee

## Submission

```bash
tar czvf <your-netid>.tgz input1 input2 input3
```
