# Project ideas

## General guideline

In this page, I list a few *exemplary* project ideas to help you. Please note that this is to give you a guideline regarding my expectation for the course project.

I wish the list can help you developing the right senses for the proper problem definition, size of the project, and techniques to be used. The list generally reflects my research interest and expertise, and I believe you can think hard to find security problems that would interest you the most. My preference is to see your project is about a problem defined and proposed by you. It is always better to have a course project in which you find yourself interested.
It is okay for you to pick one of the following project ideas. Taking it as one starting point, you can either work all the way or diverge to pursue your direction as the project proceeds.

The course is about *system security* and I expect the course project and related techniques remain around the vicinity of system security topics and techniques. However, if you are compelled to have a problem less relevant to system security, please feel free to find me and discuss. The bottom line is that it still has to be a security problem.

Please find your team members as early as you can and have as much discussion as possible. If you need any help or want to consult with me, you can always find me during my office hours or send an email to set up an appointment. 

### Expected outcomes

The followings project outcomes that I expect to see at the end of semester.

* Project documentation (small/medium version research paper)
* Project source code with documentations (comments, API ...)
* Project Demo

For the course project, I will strongly encourage students to aim high to produce an outcome with larger impact. With an interesting problem, and solid result, a student or a team of students can shoot for undergraduate or master thesis or a publication from a academic conference.
