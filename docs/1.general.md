## Course Description

CS 6332 is a graduate-level, research-oriented, systems, and software, security
class. From the course student will learn initialization process of operating
system and its subsequent process executions; principles of dynamic and static
analysis approaches to monitor, analyze, and mitigate both benign and malicious
programs; various techniques for reverse engineering binaries, bytecodes,
obfuscated (packed) malware. Lastly, the course will cover the state of the art
attacks techniques..

### Learning expectations

Through this course, student will learn the basic principles regarding; How
computer operates in general which includes how it load from BIOS and
subsequently boots up Operating Systems for a given hard. How it loads programs
and runs it from the memory space with different execution models such as direct
and hypervisor-based execution of the binary. The execution of program atop
language run-times (Python, JVM, Golang, and Rust).

Based on this understanding students will learn both attack and defense
technics. Attack techniques: Buffer overflow, Heap overflow, Integer overflow,
Return-oriented programming, Signal-oriented programming, Packing. Defense and
analysis techniques: Program obfuscation, Binary randomization, Static and
dynamic binary analysis. Reverse engineering bytecode and different
instrumentation techniques for analysis and mitigation purposes.
